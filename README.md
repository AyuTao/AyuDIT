# AyuDITools: The Professional, Subscription-Free DIT Software for DaVinci Resolve

`AyuDITools` is not just a plugin; it is a complete and powerful DIT (Digital Imaging Technician) software solution built directly within DaVinci Resolve Studio. It is designed to be a perfect, subscription-free alternative to expensive annual-fee software like Pomfort Silverstack Lab and Foolcat.

## Why AyuDITools?

The vision for `AyuDITools` was born from a major shift in the post-production landscape. With DaVinci Resolve 20's native support for Apple ProRes RAW, the platform has become a truly universal tool, capable of handling nearly every format and unifying the entire post-production workflow. 

This presented a unique opportunity: to leverage the power of Resolve's backend to create a comprehensive DIT tool without the high costs. With `AyuDITools`, you no longer need to pay for expensive annual licenses. All you need is a license for DaVinci Resolve Studio.
